## Issues Resolved

### 1. Inconsistent Trust Score & Effective Amount Calculation
**Problem:** Three different places calculated effective amounts differently:
- `CarbonEntry.save()` - NO buffer pool deduction
- `VerificationService.calculate_effective_amount()` - WITH buffer pool deduction  
- `CarbonOffsetViewSet.create()` - MANUAL buffer pool application

**Solution:** Centralized all calculations in `VerificationService.apply_verification_results()`

### 2. Conflicting Buffer Pool Logic
**Problem:** Multiple buffer pool calculations with different percentages
- Manual calculation in views.py
- Automatic calculation in verification service
- Different percentages used in different places

**Solution:** Single source of truth in `VerificationService` with industry-standard percentages:
- Self-reported: 20% buffer pool
- Community verified: 15% buffer pool  
- Certified project: 10% buffer pool

### 3. Trust Score Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Trust scores calculated in multiple places with different logic
**Solution:** Centralized in `VerificationService.TRUST_SCORES` constant

### 4. Missing Verification Processing Flag
**Problem:** `CarbonEntry.save()` could override verification service calculations
**Solution:** Added `_verification_processed` flag to prevent conflicts

## New Centralized Flow

1. **CarbonEntry Creation** ‚Üí Basic model creation with default values
2. **Verification Service** ‚Üí `verify_offset_entry()` runs all checks
3. **Apply Results** ‚Üí `apply_verification_results()` sets final values
4. **Single Save** ‚Üí All changes saved together with processing flag

## Verification Formula

```python
effective_amount = base_amount * trust_score * (1 - buffer_deduction)
```

Where:
- `trust_score`: 0.5 (self), 0.75 (community), 1.0 (certified)
- `buffer_deduction`: 0.20 (self), 0.15 (community), 0.10 (certified)

## Files Modified

1. `carbon/models.py` - Fixed `CarbonEntry.save()` method
2. `carbon/services/verification_service.py` - Added `apply_verification_results()`
3. `carbon/views.py` - Updated `CarbonOffsetViewSet.create()` to use centralized service
4. `documentation/COMPLETE_OFFSET_VERIFICATION_PROCESS.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing

Run verification tests to ensure all calculations are consistent:
```bash
cd trazo-back
poetry run python test_third_party_verification.py
```

All tests should pass with consistent effective amount calculations.
