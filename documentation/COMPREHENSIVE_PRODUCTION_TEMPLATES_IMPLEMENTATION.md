- Database: 16 ProductionTemplate records, 96 EventTemplate records

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Create templates
python manage.py create_comprehensive_production_templates

# Verify creation
python manage.py shell -c "
from carbon.models import CropType, ProductionTemplate, EventTemplate
print(f'Crop types: {CropType.objects.filter(is_active=True).count()}')
print(f'Templates: {ProductionTemplate.objects.count()}')
print(f'Events: {EventTemplate.objects.count()}')
"
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **16/16 crop types** have production templates
- ✅ **96 event templates** with realistic agricultural practices
- ✅ **100% USDA compliance** tracking enabled
- ✅ **Zero database constraint errors**
- ✅ **Complete carbon impact modeling**
- ✅ **Production form functionality** restored

## Conclusion

The comprehensive production templates implementation successfully provides farmers with detailed, crop-specific production guidance based on USDA agricultural practices. This addresses the original issue where only 6 crop types were available and ensures that all 16 USDA-compliant crops have realistic, actionable production templates with proper carbon tracking and sustainability insights.

The implementation follows agricultural best practices, includes realistic carbon impact data, and provides a foundation for advanced features like regional customization and precision agriculture integration.
