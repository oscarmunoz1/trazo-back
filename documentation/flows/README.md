# Trazo Application Flow Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for all major system flows in the Trazo agricultural carbon transparency platform. Each document provides detailed technical implementation details, API endpoints, database interactions, and system diagrams.

## Overview

Trazo is an agricultural carbon transparency platform that enables farmers to track, verify, and monetize their carbon footprint through:

- **Real-time carbon calculation** using USDA-verified emission factors
- **Blockchain verification** on Polygon network for immutable records
- **QR code transparency** for consumer trust and traceability
- **Subscription-based SaaS model** with feature gating
- **Mobile-first design** optimized for field operations

## Core System Architecture

### Backend (Django REST API)
- **Carbon App**: Carbon calculations, USDA integration, blockchain verification
- **Company App**: Business and establishment (farm) management
- **History App**: Production event tracking and QR code generation
- **Product App**: Parcel (land plot) management with geospatial data
- **Users App**: Multi-tenant authentication with role-based access
- **Subscriptions App**: Stripe-integrated billing with feature gating
- **Education App**: Sustainability education content

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Redux Toolkit + RTK Query**: State management and API calls
- **Chakra UI**: Component library with responsive design
- **Vite**: Build system optimized for mobile performance
- **Progressive Loading**: QR scanning performance optimization

### Key Integrations
- **Blockchain**: Polygon network with smart contracts
- **USDA APIs**: Real-time agricultural emission factors
- **Stripe**: Subscription payments and billing
- **AWS S3**: File storage and image management
- **OpenAI**: AI-powered voice event processing
