# Trazo MVP Implementation Plan (Development Team)

## Introduction
This 6-month MVP implementation plan is designed for the Trazo development team to enhance the platform’s carbon transparency mission. It focuses on technical improvements in USDA integration, blockchain optimization, IoT expansion, and system scalability, excluding partnerships and marketing. The plan ensures compliance with USDA standards, scalability for 1000+ farmers, and robust data accuracy.

## Current System Overview
Trazo’s architecture includes:
- **Backend**: Django 4.x, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Redis for caching, Celery for tasks, deployed on AWS/Heroku with Docker.
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI, Redux Toolkit, PWA with offline sync.
- **Integrations**: USDA emission factors, Polygon Amoy testnet, John Deere API, weather APIs, speech recognition.
- **Features**: Smart event templates, voice-to-event system, mobile-first interface, carbon calculation engine, IoT integration, consumer QR codes.

## Technical Challenges
- **USDA Integration**: Limited to basic emission factors; needs real-time API integration and verification processes.
- **Blockchain**: Testnet-based; requires production network and gas-efficient smart contracts.
- **IoT**: John Deere-only; needs multi-vendor support and standardized protocols.
- **Scalability**: Must handle 1000+ farmers with <200ms API response times.
- **Data Accuracy**: Requires USDA-compliant verification and robust validation.
